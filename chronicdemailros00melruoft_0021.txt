PREFACE. v

of error, confusion, and contradiction, it is impossible to avoid
arriving at the conviction that the celebrated author of the
Scottish Historical Library has written his notice of this im-
portant chronicle without giving himself the trouble of examin-

and recent transcripts from this original.

The Oxford edition, although ‘not meriting the character
which we have seen has been bestowed upon it, is yet‘ by no
means satisfactory. Without intending to derogate from the

the apology is of a very dubious character when the conjecture
is hazarded that Fulman‚ the editor of the edition of 1684,
followed, as his sole authority, a transcript now preserved at
Oxford,† and that he appears to have had no opportunity of
