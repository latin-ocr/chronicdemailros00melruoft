have in Seotland.” Strange to say, these very words are to be
found in the Oxford edition.¹¹⁸⁸ Yet one os his subsequent ob-
servations seems intended to prove that the Scottish copies are
less copious than the decried English edition, for he tells us that
all “ these manuscript copies in Scotland† end with the words
‘ Obiit Adam de Kilcontath [l. Kilconcath] comes de Karryc in
Actonia [l. Aeconia], cujus uxorem [Diuam nominess] comitissam
de Karryc‚ postea junior Robertus de Bruys accepit in spon-
sam ;’ ” which demonstrates that they contain about two pages
less than is given by the Oxford edition. He then adds the
colophon appended to these transcriptS, which states that “Haec
est vera copia antiquae Cronicae de Melros in Scotia, inchoata
per abbatem de Dundranan, ab anno 735, continuata per varios
ad annum 1270. Autographum extat in Bibliotheca Do. Ro-
berti Cotton, militis, apud Westmonasterium.’' He attempts
to obscure this clear statement by observing, “Now, though
this is said to be a transcript of that in Cotton's Library, yet he

† Two copies are mentioned in the first volume of the catalogue of the Advocates’ Lib-

This last I have had an opportunity of examining3 it is a small quarto, marked F. vii, 23,
formerly belonging to Sir James Balfour, by whom it was transcribed from the original.
It ends in the same manner as those mentioned by Nicolson‚ aster which follows the
colophon of the transcriber, as given in the text. As it was in the poffiession of the
University in the year 1700, it is not improbable that N icolson made his memoranda
from this copy, when on a visit to his ‘³ worthy stiend, Mr Robert Wudrow, library-keeper
at Glasgow.”
