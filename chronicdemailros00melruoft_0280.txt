APPENDIX.

Aster this a continuation seems to have been made in the ensuing reign of

Alexander the Third, and it concludes with these words:
“ Nomen habet patris, utinam patris acta sequatur
Filius, Albaniae qui modo sceptra tenet.”

Aster this I find no more of this elegiae verse, although there are frequent quo·
tations of poetry interspersed in the continuation of Fordun, which are generally
in Hexameter verse.

No part of this poem seems to have been known to Fordun, as may be pre-
sumed by that part of the Scottichronicon, which he himself finished‚ having no
extracts from it3 vide Fordun, edit. Gale et Hearne.

The first part, concluding with Macbeth and Lulach, was interpolated in the
Chronicle of Melrose, and was known to W[yntown], who has interwoven it

through his work. .

The additions of the second edition were also inserted in the Chronicle of

Melrose.

A manuscript in the Bodleian Library, c. iv. 3, has the whole, with some
variations.

Bower has inserted almost the whole in his copy and continuation of Fordun.

J ohannes Abbas Sancti Petri de Burgo* says, sub anno 975, that the Chro-
nicon Elegiacum was composed by Alred, who was bred up with Hem-y, son of
David the First, and he may have composed the first part, or perhaps added the
second part, and hence got the credit of being author of the whole.
