xii PREFACE.

‘⁴ vetusta chronica.”* Since, however, the early portion of . our
Chronicle be but a compilation from other historiam, it may be
asked if F ordun did not derive these notices from the same
common sources from which they were introduced into the
Chronicle of Melrose3 but such was not the case, as will ap-
pear by a comparison of those passages which have undergone
abridgement or alteration in being transcribed from the Eng-
lish original.†

Wyntoun cites some information from “cornyklys awld,’'‡
a reference-which, as the learned Maepherson observeS, is “ ap-
parently the Chronicle of Melrose.’'§

The Chronicle of Lanercost contains many sentences trans-
cribed from that of Melrose3 and a comparison of the two
leads to the conclusion that the copy was made by the English
monks from the manuscript now preserved in the Cottonian
library.ss From these observations it appearS, that although,
on the one hand, we must give our ancestors credit for possess-
ing a considerable share of the genuine spirit of literary accom-
modafflon, in thus transmitting into various parts of Scotland, if
not into England, a volume to which they must have attached

⁵ Vol. i. p. 265, l. 6 ; cs. Chron. Mel. p. 55, l. 25.

† For instance, Fordun, vol, i. p. 270, l. 2, when speaking of the prisoners whom Wil-
liam the Conqueror requested to be freed, mentions “ Vulnotum regis Haroldi germanum,
quem a pueritia in custodia,” obviously omitting a verb necessary for the completion of the
sense. The same words are in the Chronicle os Melrose, p. 59, l. 4; but the original

authority, Hoveden‚ supplies the necessary verb, “tenuerat,” fol. 264, l. 23.
ss Vol. i. p. 146.

ξ Vol. ii. p. 464.

u The Chronicle of Lanercost details the ravages committed in Cumberland by Alexan-
der the Second in the same words as those employed by the monk of Melrose; but in turn·-
ing the folio of his original he has accidentally omitted a word, reading—“ non magistri
sed ministri malitiae,” instead of—“ non magistri militiae, sed ministri malitiae,³' p. 1233 thus
sailing to preserve a monastic playing upon words too much in accordanee with the taste
of the period to be intentionally omitted. It occurs again atp. 246.
