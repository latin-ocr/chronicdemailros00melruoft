BREFACE. xiii

no small value3 yet we are compelled, on the other, to own
that their habits of original thinking and observation were
proportionally weakened by thus slavishly adopting sentiments
and vieWS, in some instanceS, opposed to what must have been
their original impressionS. We also see the utility of tracing‚
as far as possible, to their source, the various -materials from
which the early portion of this, as of almost all our chronicles‚
are formed, of noting those peculiarities arising from time,
locality, or other adventitious circumstanceS, which may tend
to throw a colouring over the testimony of the narrator3 and
of distinguishing that portion of the history which is a compila-
tion from anterior writerS, whose works are preserved, from that
which is the result of the historian's own observation‚ or which,
from creditable authority, he may think worthy of being re—
corded. If such writers as Hoveden, Knyghton, Walsingham‚
Matthew of Westminster, and many otherS, both English and
Scottish‚ were subjected to such a scrutiny, the advantage of the
system would soon be obvious; their bulky volumes would
dwindle into pageS, and their authority, as historica] evidence,
be confined within thirty or forty years anterior to the period
in which the respective authors lived. The only use to which
we could turn the rejected matter, would be to afford various
readings for the works which form the basis of each compila-
tion; thuS‚ for instance, the manuscripts of F lorence of Worces-
ter would furnish a better text of Asser’s life of Alfred; the
manuscripts of Hoveden might be collated for a new edition
of Simeon of Durham and Benedictus Abbas; and the copies
of Walsingham might serve to compensate for the loss of all
save the one existing manuscript of the valuable chronicles of

Troklowe and Blaneford.
