'viii PREFACE.

however much the expression commented upon, when ‘viewed
under the influence of modern prejudiceS, might seem a proof
of an English origin, it could not at first convey any such idea. -

That the English authorship of this early part of the history
may appear the more obviouS, Nicolson* argues that the mo-
nastery of Melrose itself seems to have been in the hands of the
English, from the fact that Waltheof, brother to Henryv earl of
N orthumberland, and of Simon earl of Northampton, in whom
he recognises only the scion of a southern family, was made
abbot of Melrose3 forgetting that his mother, the countess Ma-
tilda,† became the wife of David, prince of Cumberland, who
afterwards ascended the throne of Scotland.

The same writer sayS,‡ that “in the year 1157, the abbot of ,
Dundrainan, or some of his countrymen, was most probably the
scribe; this being the accountwhich he giVes of the Scotch king’s
homage: Rex Malcolmus Scotorum veniens ad regem Angliae
Henricum apud Cestriam devenit homo quS, eo modo quo avus
suus fuerat homo veteris regis Henrici, &albis omnibus πέφαται
tibus suiS.” Unfortunately, however, for this theory, the pas-
sage has been transcribed verbatim from Hoveden.§ He further
states that this is not noticed in the Oxford edition, ‘⁶ but only
in the manuscript copy which they have in Scotland,'’ but the
passage is in the Oxford editionss
