xiv PREFACE.

The Chronicon Rythmicum, which has been introduced into
the Chronicle of Melrose by a hand of the early part of the
fourteenth century, must be considered an interpolation, and
is totally unconnected with the history in which it is found; as
such, it has been separated from the text, and placed at the end
of the volume? The same has been done with the contents of
fol. 53 of the manuscript,† containing memoranda, which, in
an extended form, have been inserted in their respective places
in the text.

When, or by what meanS, the manuscript now in the British
Museum came into the hands of Sir Robert Cotton, cannot
now be ascertained. The Editor is inclined to think that by
some accident it was carried off from Melrose at a period, if
not anterior to, at least immediately after, the Reformation.
Had it been preserved there when Viscount Haddington had
a grant of the abbey-landS, it is probable that he would have
preserved it along with the splendid collection of charters‡
which came into his possession upon that occasion, or that some
extracts from it would have been found in his “Collections of
CharterS, EvidentS, and AntiquitieS‚’' now in the Advocates'

'¹' P. 223. Macpherson, in a note in his copy of the Chronicle of Melrose, printed p.
236, and in his edition of Wyntoun, vol. ii. p. 471, considers that this metrical chronicle
is the production of Ailred of 'Rievaux. Pinkerton, in his Enquiry into the History of
scotland, vol. ii. p. 334, has printed various readings and additions from the Bodleian MS.
c. iv. 3, which he says is of the thirteenth century3 but unless art. 17 of the Catalogue be
added by a later hand, we must conclude that the writing is posterior to 1356.

† Appendix 1.

ss Many hundred original charters, from the time of David the First to the Reforma-
tion, have lately been secured by Thomas Thomson, esquire, Deputy Clerk Register for
Scotland3 and the'se, together with the addition of others froin the chartulas-ies of Mel,-
rosc, are in the course of publication by that gentleman. It is probable that when that
most important work shall appear, the abbey of Melrose will have more numerous literar-y
monuments of its former grandeur than any ecelesiastical establishment in scotland.
