PREFACE. xi

ferred to Simeon of Durham? so obvious is it that any fur-
ther proof would be unnecessary. Hoveden, too, whose history
is for the most part a repetition of the prior labours of Simeon
of Durham and Henry of Huntingdon, appears to have furnish-
ed some of the peculiarities where a departure from the text'of
Simeon is observable. Even during this early period there are
introduced passages which must be considered original.† From
about the year 1140 to the end, the information of the chro-
nicle may be considered as original, and the numerous and
progressive variations in the handwriting show that it is very
frequently, if not alwayS, contemporaneous

The Chronicle of Melrose became, in its turn, the source
from which other chronicles de'duced portions of their infor-
mation. F ordun has followed it in passages without number,
of which a very few are indicated in the note below,‡ and cites
it as ‘⁶ quaedum antiqua Chronica‚''§ “antiquum scriptum,''ss or

Florence, and, from him, Simeon, here style Ella “ tyrannum,'' but in the
Saxon text he is termed “ ungecyndne cyning,'' of which “ degenerem” is
a translation.

It would not be difficult to extend the number of instances equally conclusive.

⁴* The copy of Simeon which was used in the compilation of the present chronicle seems
to have contained the additions of John Prior of Hexham3 compare the two authorities
under the year 1131.

† For instance, the notes of the origin and progress of the Tyronensian Order under the
years 1109, 1113, 1115, 1118, etc.

ss Compare the following passages :—
Chron. of Melrose. For-dun.

It would be easy to multiply instances, but they are too obvious to require notice.
