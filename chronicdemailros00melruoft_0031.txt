library.* The extracts in the Cottonian volume, Otho, D. iv„
formerly belonging to Lord Burleigh, are written in a hand
considerably prior to the year 1600, and were made from
the original manuscript now in the same noble library. A
few excerpts, relative to Simon de Montfort, are amongst
Stowe's Collections in the Harleian library;† and from some
memoranda kept by Sir Robert Cotton, it appears that in 1623
he lent the “manuscript chronicle of Melros” to Selden, who
was the first to cite it in print.‡ As already has been noticed,
it was transcribed, under his directionS, for the intended second
volume of the English historians; and had that -work appeared,
the present edition would probably have been unnecessary‚ for
Selden and Twysden conducted their labours with more care
than seems to have been bestowed by F ulman upon his edi-
tion.

From what has been advanced, the Editor believes that the

following conclusions have been established :--

First, That the Cottonian manuscript, Faustina, B. ix„ is the
only ancient copy,§ and that all others are transcripts
from this one original.

ξ It is worthy of remark that the Cottonian library possesses another manuscript which
originated in the Scriptorium of Melrose. The volume marked Julius, B. xiii. contains,
besides other matter, a short chronicle, extending stom the birth of our Saviour to the year
249. The strongly marked character of the handwriting, exhibiting itself in the sys-
tematic adherence to peculiarities in the use and formation of certain letters and symbols,
proves), beyond a doubt, that the scribe was the same as he who commenced the Chronicle
of Melrose. Had not that worthy monk prefaced his labours by an introduction showing
the predetermined and satisfactory principle which led him to commence his annals with
the year 735, the perfect similarity between the two Cottonian manuscripts in the size of
the vellum, the number of lines in each page, the arrangement of the text, and other coinci-

dences, might almost lead to the belief that both these manuscripts were originally destined
to form one volume. .
