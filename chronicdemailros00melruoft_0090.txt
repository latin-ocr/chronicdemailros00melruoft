¹ The locality of “Abernithi’' has been a subject of controversy. See Haila, i. 15; Chalnoers, i. 418.
As some of the arguments there adduced are founded upon the meaning of the word ‘¹ gewaede‚’'
which occurs in the account given in the Sat. Clu-on. I may remark, that Gibson is in error when
he states, that it is expressive of the river Tweed3 instead of which, it is the common Saxon word
for a ford, and is frequent in the languages of the North. Ihre, ii. 1024. Itis common in names
of places, such as Langwath, Monast. Anglic. ii. 602, 6433 Sandwath, p. 1·51; Howath, p. 507 ;
and, in p. 903, mention is made of a “ villa quae dicitur Wath.” It subsequently became peculiar
to the north of England. Camden’s Renmz'ns, p. 1003 Skinner, in voce. Places ending in “ war-th‚”
which seems in several instances a corruption of “ wath,” are generally situated on the banks osa
river, near a ford. Craven Gloes, ii. 241. No argument, as to locality, can therefore be deduced
from this word. In compliance with a wish expressed by Lord Hailes, i. 16, the following MSS.
of authors who mention this meeting have been consulted, but without conferring any advantage
upon their respective texts. For Florence qf Worcester, the Cottonian MS. Vitell. E. xiii.; for
Radulfus de Dic-eto, the Cottonian MS. Claud. E. iii. The same event is recorded in a short
Chronicle preserved in the Arundel MS„ 22ος see also for accounts of the same event, Hoveden,
fol. 260. b.; Hen. quuntingdon, fol. 211. b.; W. Malmesbur. fol. 58; Wynt. i. 270; Atwood, cap.
xxii. when discussing this event, cites the narratives of ordericus Vitatis, the Regi-der qubae‘ngdon,
(Gott. MS. Claud. B. vi.), and the Anonymous Chroniote in the Cott. MS. Vitell. A. xx. ’ The
words here inserted within brackets are no longer legible in the MS„ but are given from the edition
of Gale. Since the period of its publication, they have been so carefully erased stom the vellum,
that there does not now remain the vestige of a single letter. See M. Paris, p. ὃς Ingulfus, edit.
Gale, p. 70. ⁸ St Gregory VII. was elected 22d of April 1079. ‘
