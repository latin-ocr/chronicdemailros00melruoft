x PREFACE.

it becomes difficult to separate, with accuracy, those passages
which can be referred to the monk of Melrose from those

which are the property of the monk of Durham. It is believed,
however, that such passages may be traced; and to do so it will
be necessary to find in the Chronicle of Melrose passages, or
peculiarities of diction or of arrangement, which, although exist-
ing in the Saxon, do not appear in the other chronicles which
are founded upon that venerable authority? It must be owned‚
however, that these isolated scraps of translation, even if col-
lected with the greatest care, would amount to no great bu]k;
and, bearing such a small proportion to the numerous and ob-
vious extracts from Latin writers whose histories have reached
us in an entire form, they cannot add very much to the value

of the early portion of our chronicle.
It is obvious from the notes appended to this edition, that
very much of the part professedly a compilation, is to be re-

* A.D. 782. The notice of the council of Acle is placed by Florence in 7813 by
Richard of Hexham in 788; Simeon and Hoveden omit the year3 the
Chron. Melr. agrees with the Saxon.

794. The last sentence in this year adheres closely to the Saxon3 Simeon,
as usual, is much more diffuse in his narrative3 Hoveden differs from both.

797. The sentence concerning pope Leo is a close version of the Saxon; Si-
meon's narrative, placed under the year 799, is considerably amplified3
Florence gives the sense, but in different words, and further removed
from the diction os the origina13 Hoveden omits it entirely.

800. The sentence “ rex Karolus,” etc„ is taken, almost verbatim, from a Latin
notice in the Laud manuscript of the Saxon Chronicle, aversion which
the compiler seems to have followed3 it is amplified and clothed in very
different language by Simeon; Hoveden omits it.

833. This year is omitted by Simeon; Florence has it, but in an abridged form3
Hoveden nearly agrees with the Chron. Melr„ but is less correct and close
in translating from the Saxon.

851. The notice of the Danish invasion is probably a direct extract from the
Sax- Chronicle, although Florence’s narrative approaches nearly to the
same source; Simeon and Hoveden give it differently.

866. The use of the word “ degenerem,” in our chronicle‚ is worthy of notice ς
